# Messager
made this messaging app in godot to learn about multiplayer

I used godot's NetworkedMultiplayerENet to make it.

# Hosting
Hosting needs a name, port, and max players.

the port must be port forwarded for people to join, and max players must be numerical.

# Joining
Joining needs a name, ip, and port

self-explanatory, just enter the ip and port of the host that the host specified when making it.
